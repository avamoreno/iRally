           <p><i>iRally</i> is a website whose main focus is to help the youth of today become more politically involved and aware of the political climate surrounding them. It works towards providing helpful information about potential candidates, student organizations, and events near you.</p></div>
       
        <div class="grid-item">
            
            <center><h3>I've never been politically involved, how do I get started?</h3></center>
            
            <p>A great way to get started is to take the Candidate quiz located above in the menu bar. The quiz will help you determine which candidates you most match with based on your beliefs. From there, you can look at student organizations that correlate with your beliefs or look at different events going on in your area.</p></div>
            
       <div class="grid-item">
           
                <center><h3>How accurate is the Candidate Quiz?</h3></center>
           
           <p>The Candidate quiz compiles all of your information, beliefs, and political views to help you find the candidate that best matched you personally. However, the quiz is not 100% accurate. While the results of the quiz give you the best possible match, you are free to <i>rally</i> with whomever you chose. </p></div>

                    <p>To submit an event that you would like to become public, go to the "Events Near You" tab and follow the instructions to submit an event or proposal. </p></div>
